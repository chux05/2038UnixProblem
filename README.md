# 2038 Unix Problem Timer
This is just a countdown timer (client-side) that keeps track of when the 2038 Unix Problem will occur. You can read all about it here:

This timer will most likely not be accurate because it is being handled by the client, which means whatever time that's on your computer will be used. Doing server-side time tracking is just too much work for a boring Sunday. Decided to write some code, because why not?
